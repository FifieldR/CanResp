# CanResp

Welcome To CanResp
CanResp is a program created by Ryan Fifield
Using AutoHotKey
And (maybe) the Acc.ahk library
This program was made to bind some of our canned responses to some hotkeys mainly using printscreen and pause as our initiator.
If you have any issues with this program or have any suggestions send me an email at ryan.fifield@axis.com with the subject line stating one of the following: 
CanResp Suggestion
CanResp Issue

You are free to edit the code in anyway, but if you have and it breaks you have surrendered the right to ask me for help or troubleshooting. 
This program is VERY fragile and held together with thumbtacks and tape, so this is not recommended.

Upon first running of the program you will be told that you do not have a CanResp.conf file, this file will hold your name and title. The program will start a conf Set Up process asking you to input info. After you finish the setup, you should see a pop-up that says your name and title. If not, check the CanResp.conf file to see if it was moved out of the directory the program is in.

To open the conf file editor use Pause + c
